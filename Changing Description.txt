Project: PDF-to-Markdown
Date: 2026-02-23

Changes:
1. Environment Management:
   - Renamed Conda environment from `Code-Project` to `PDF-to-Markdown`.
   - Removed old `Code-Project` environment.
   - Cleaned up irrelevant files in `PDF-to-Markdown` project directory.

2. Code Enhancements (run_mineru.py):
   - Added support for user-provided PDF input path.
   - Implemented `optimize_output` function to:
     - Remove intermediate `_origin.pdf` file.
     - Compress all non-markdown assets (images, layout files) into `assets.zip` to save space.
     - Update Markdown file to include a note about the compressed assets.
   - Added `create_changing_description` function to auto-generate this log.
   - Improved path handling to ensure all work is confined to the project directory.

3. Output Processing:
   - Processed `MONT.pdf` successfully.
   - Post-processed output to move images to `assets/` folder and update Markdown links.
   - Compressed `assets/` folder into `assets.zip` as requested.

4. Troubleshooting:
   - Identified `tmpvk7y2itv.bat` as a safe temporary file generated by system calls/libraries during execution.
